# Worker & Thread-Safe Queue

![CI](https://github.com/sergioguerreroblanco-oss/worker_cola_multithread/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

**Worker & Queue** is a modern C++14 project demonstrating a **multithreaded worker pool** that executes queued tasks concurrently using a **thread-safe queue**.  
It was developed as a **technical test** but structured as a production-quality module, including **unit testing, logging, Docker support, CI/CD integration, and clean CMake presets**.

---

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Thread-safe generic queue (`ThreadSafeQueue<T>`)**  
  - Implements synchronized access using `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`.  
  - Provides `push()`, `pop()`, `try_pop()`, `empty()`, `size()`, `clear()`, and `close()` methods.  
  - Supports blocking `pop()` that waits for new data or shutdown signals.  
  - Designed for safe use across multiple producers and consumers.

- **Worker Pool (`WorkerPool`)**  
  - A simple yet efficient thread pool built around `ThreadSafeQueue<std::function<void()>>`.  
  - Spawns multiple worker threads that consume and execute submitted tasks concurrently.  
  - Provides lifecycle control via `start()`, `submit()`, and `stop()`.  
  - Ensures graceful shutdown and task draining before termination.  

- **Logging System (`Logger`)**  
  - Thread-safe static utility for centralized logging.  
  - Configurable minimum log level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`).  
  - Adds timestamp and severity to each log line.  
  - Used across all components for consistent diagnostics.

---

## üåü Project Highlights

- **Unit testing** with GoogleTest (`ctest` integrated).  
- **Thread-safe design**: no data races or undefined behavior in queue or pool.  
- **CMake presets** for consistent builds (`debug` / `release`).  
- **Cross-platform**: builds cleanly on Linux, Windows, and inside Docker.  
- **CI integration** via GitHub Actions:
  - Builds and runs all unit tests automatically.
  - Validates Docker image reproducibility.
- **Reproducible builds** using a minimal **Ubuntu 22.04** image and **CMake 3.28**.
- **Strict compiler flags** (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`) to enforce quality and correctness.
- **C++14 compliance** ‚Äî no dependency on newer standards.

## üèó Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the internal architecture of the project:

Main Thread acts as the producer ‚Äî it submits tasks (lambdas or callable functions) to the ThreadSafeQueue.

ThreadSafeQueue<T> safely synchronizes access to the task queue among multiple producers and worker threads.

WorkerPool manages a configurable number of worker threads.

Each Worker Thread repeatedly calls pop() to retrieve and execute tasks until the queue is closed.

The Logger provides synchronized output from all threads, ensuring readable and timestamped logs.

### Windows (PowerShell/CLI)
You can also build manually from a terminal with CMake presets:

```powershell
cmake --preset release    # Configure for Release
cmake --build --preset release -j  # Build using Ninja or MSBuild

cmake --preset debug      # Configure for Debug (with tests)
cmake --build --preset debug -j
ctest --preset debug      # Run unit tests
```
---

### Linux / WSL (Debian/Ubuntu based)
Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build git
```
Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergioguerreroblanco-oss/worker_cola_multithread.git
cd worker_cola_multithread

cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release -j$(nproc)

```bash
docker build -t cola-worker:local .
docker run --rm cola-worker:local
```

---

## üß™ Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented with GoogleTest and integrated into the CMake build system via CTest.
They validate the core behavior of both ThreadSafeQueue and WorkerPool to ensure thread-safe operation and correct synchronization between producer and consumer threads.

### ‚úÖ Covered Scenarios

- ThreadSafeQueue
    - push() / pop() correctly transfer ownership of elements.
    - try_pop() safely handles empty queues.
    - close() unblocks waiting threads gracefully.
    - size() and empty() reflect real state under concurrency.

- WorkerPool
    - All submitted tasks are executed.
    - Supports variable worker counts.
    - Handles shutdown correctly, waiting for ongoing tasks.
    - Properly joins all threads at stop.

### Running Tests (Windows)

On Windows, the project has been validated with Visual Studio 2022.
Tests can be executed directly from Test Explorer:
```Menu ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Run All Tests```

Alternatively, you can also build and run tests using the provided CMake presets:
```powershell
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug --output-on-failure
```
> Note - Need to have installed: 
> 1. [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v4.1.1/cmake-4.1.1-windows-x86_64.msi)

## üé® Code Style (clang-format)

This project uses **clang-format** to enforce a consistent C++ code style.  
The formatting rules are defined in [`.clang-format`](./.clang-format). 

### üîß Chosen Style

The configuration is based on Google C++ Style, with a few modifications to improve readability for embedded and multithreaded systems:

| Setting                                 | Value               | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BasedOnStyle**                        | `Google`            | Provides a solid, modern baseline for C++ formatting.                            |
| **Language**                            | `Cpp`               | Ensures C++-specific syntax rules (not generic C).                               |
| **IndentWidth / TabWidth**              | `4`                 | Uses 4 spaces per indent (vs Google‚Äôs default 2) for improved block readability. |
| **UseTab**                              | `Never`             | Enforces spaces only (consistent across editors).                                |
| **ColumnLimit**                         | `100`               | Balances readability and long template expressions.                              |
| **BreakBeforeBraces**                   | `Allman`            | Places braces on their own line, improving visual structure in nested code.      |
| **AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine** | `false`             | Forces explicit line breaks for clarity.                                         |
| **AllowShortLoopsOnASingleLine**        | `false`             | Prevents compact loop bodies from being overlooked.                              |
| **AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine**    | `Inline`            | Allows concise inline functions on a single line only.                           |
| **PointerAlignment**                    | `Left`              | Keeps `T* ptr` instead of `T *ptr` ‚Äî cleaner and more conventional in C++.       |
| **DerivePointerAlignment**              | `false`             | Disables automatic guessing; enforces explicit `PointerAlignment`.               |
| **SpaceBeforeParens**                   | `ControlStatements` | Adds a space in `if (` / `while (` for readability, not for calls.               |
| **SortIncludes**                        | `true`              | Automatically organizes include directives alphabetically.                       |
| **IncludeBlocks**                       | `Regroup`           | Groups and reorders includes logically within the file.                          |
| **AlignConsecutiveAssignments**         | `true`              | Improves alignment of variable assignments.                                      |
| **AlignConsecutiveDeclarations**        | `true`              | Aligns consecutive variable declarations.                                        |
| **AlignOperands**                       | `true`              | Keeps arithmetic/logical expressions neatly aligned.                             |
| **CommentPragmas**                      | `'^!'`              | Allows pragma-specific comment formatting.                                       |
| **FixNamespaceComments**                | `true`              | Automatically adds trailing `// namespace X` comments when closing.              |
| **SpacesBeforeTrailingComments**        | `2`                 | Keeps a consistent gap before end-of-line comments.                              |
| **KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks**    | `false`             | Avoids unnecessary blank lines at block starts.                                  |

## üìå Notes

- **C++ Standard**: C++ 14 (set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)).
    
    Since std::optional is only available from C++ 17, this project integrates the lightweight [optional-lite](https://github.com/nonstd-lite/optional-lite) library (include/third_party/optional.hpp) to preserve equivalent semantics while remaining compatible with C++14.
- **Thread Safety**: Fully managed through std::mutex, std::condition_variable, and std::atomic.

    All shared data access is synchronized using RAII-based locking (std::lock_guard, std::unique_lock).

- **Extensibility**:
    
    The worker logic is decoupled from its execution policy through a clear separation of responsibilities.
    The WorkerPool manages concurrency, while individual tasks (via std::function<void()>) define behavior ‚Äî allowing flexible and testable extensions.

- **Logging**:

    Centralized thread-safe Logger utility with severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR), ensuring coherent runtime diagnostics across threads.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:

    Successfully builds and runs on:

        - ü™ü Windows (MSVC 2022)
        - üêß Linux (g++)
        - üê≥ Docker container environments

        Each environment uses consistent CMake presets to simplify builds and CI/CD automation.

- **Queue Implementation**:
    
    ThreadSafeQueue<T> uses an internal std::deque<T> instead of a custom circular buffer.
    This approach prioritizes simplicity, STL optimization, and correctness, while maintaining a deterministic FIFO order.
    A fixed-size limit could be trivially added, but for this design, unbounded size with explicit control (close(), clear()) provides better testability and robustness.

- **Design Decision: Graceful Shutdown Philosophy**
    
    Earlier designs included explicit shutdown signaling (shutdown() with return states like OK, TIMEOUT, CLOSED).
    This was intentionally removed to keep the queue a pure, passive synchronization primitive.
    Instead, lifecycle management occurs externally:

        - The WorkerPool sets a closed flag and signals all waiting threads via notify_all().
        - Each worker exits naturally after completing the next pop() cycle.
        - This approach avoids adding control logic into the data structure, preserving single-responsibility and predictable synchronization semantics.
